## Recommended: native extension

The native extension in `facades/vscode-extension/` provides **Instalación A UN SOLO clic**:

- bundles the `baldr-router` wheel;
- prepares a private Python environment automatically;
- registers Baldr as an MCP server programmatically;
- detects host, Windows/WSL, and Remote WSL;
- stores an optional Context7 key in VS Code SecretStorage;
- contributes a dedicated Baldr Activity Bar console with durable work items;
- exposes one Command Palette entry and keeps chat as an optional shortcut;
- continues follow-up prompts in the same durable item from Chat or Console;
- resolves the active folder in multi-root workspaces from references, the editor, or an explicit picker;
- includes bounded active-file, selection, dirty-buffer, and diagnostic context;
- renders workflow phases, cancellation, reconciliation, evidence, and resolved execution profiles.

Install the generated artifact:

```text
dist/artifacts/baldr-router-vscode-0.20.0.vsix
```

Then use the dedicated view:

```text
Activity Bar -> Baldr
  type a task and press Enter
  + for attachments and configuration
  /new /run /status /profile /git /context /cancel /resume
```

Optional shortcuts remain available:

```text
Baldr: Open
@baldr /setup
@baldr /status
@baldr /run <task>
@baldr <task>
```

After a task finishes, the next plain prompt in the same `@baldr` chat or the
selected Console session appends a durable conversation turn and runs it on the
same work item. `/resume` remains recovery for an interrupted run; it is not
required for a normal follow-up. Final Chat responses and the Console result
card show the structured outcome first, with technical details kept secondary.

With one folder, Baldr uses it directly. With multiple folders, an explicit
reference or the active editor chooses the folder; otherwise Baldr asks. It
never silently falls back to the first workspace folder.

No workspace `mcp.json`, global npm launcher, manual Python package installation, or configuration form is needed for this path. See [`baldr-console.md`](../baldr-console/).

Provider authentication and explicit trust dialogs remain provider/VS Code security steps, not manual Baldr configuration.

## Agent Plugin facade (Preview)

`facades/vscode-agent-plugin/` bundles:

```text
/baldr-setup
/baldr-status
/baldr-run <task>
```

and a thin `.mcp.json` pointing to `baldr-router-launcher`. It intentionally contains no routing/workflow implementation.

## Generic MCP configuration

For development or users who do not want the extension:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "baldrRouter": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "baldr-router-launcher",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

When VS Code itself runs inside Remote WSL and sees the router directly:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "baldrRouter": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "baldr-router",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
