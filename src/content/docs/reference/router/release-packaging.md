v0.20.0 separates source, executable artifacts, and validation evidence.

Python artifacts are also split by responsibility: `baldr-router` is the
control plane, `baldr-agent-sdk` is the public authoring API,
`baldr-agent-builder` is the language-aware lifecycle toolchain, and
`baldr-agent-runner` is the independent local data plane. The release gate
builds and installs all four infrastructure wheels together in a clean
environment, while the VSIX continues to embed only the router wheel.

The release also emits independent npm tarballs under `artifacts/node`:

- `baldr-agent-sdk-<version>.tgz`;
- `baldr-agent-builder-typescript-<version>.tgz`.

The release gate installs the Python wheels and both npm tarballs into fresh
temporary prefixes. It requires the packaged driver to be discovered from
`PATH`, verifies that its digest is unchanged by relocation, creates and tests
a TypeScript agent, runs the official driver conformance suite and direct
Runner execution, executes the same external team through the VS Code and Kiro
facade clients, compares two byte-identical builds, publishes versions 1.0.0
and 1.1.0, rejects replacement of 1.1.0 and rolls back to 1.0.0. Evidence is
written to `dist/validation/typescript-distribution.json`.

The release workflow always builds and attests every registry artifact. Actual
registry promotion is explicit: `publish_pypi=true` publishes the five Python
packages and `publish_npm=true` publishes the TypeScript SDK and driver. PyPI
projects and the npm organization must first configure this repository as a
trusted publisher; a tag alone never publishes packages.

```text
dist/baldr-router-0.20.0-source.zip
  source, tests, docs, workflows, contracts; no runtime database or cache

dist/baldr-router-0.20.0-artifacts.zip
  wheels, VSIX, Kiro Power, Agent Plugin, SBOM and provenance
dist/baldr-router-0.20.0-validation-evidence.zip
  portable synthetic build reports only
```

Individual artifacts remain under `dist/artifacts/`. Release metadata lives in
`dist/metadata/` and includes:

```text
SBOM.spdx.json
provenance.intoto.json
secret-scan.json
```

`dist/release-manifest.json` and `dist/SHA256SUMS.txt` cover the split bundles
and individual artifacts. The source bundle must not contain:

```text
SQLite state
validation caches
node_modules
virtual environments
absolute build paths
private evidence from a user machine
```

Build and verify with one cross-platform entrypoint:

```bash
python scripts/dev.py build
python scripts/dev.py verify-release
```
